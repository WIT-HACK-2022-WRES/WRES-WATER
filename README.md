## What is the Problem?
Water scarcity is a prevalent problem in Australia, making sustainable water management  and efficient use of water essential. A shocking 85% of water consumption in Australia is contributed by businesses. The hospitality industry is often overlooked but is one of the largest consumers of water in Australia, using approximately 79,000L per day. 
In hotels, water is excessively used in guest rooms such as for showers or flushing toilets, as well as laundry and landscaping despite there being many solutions to decrease water wastage.

## Our Solution
We've come up with a system to digitalise this process and help hotels monitor and manage their water consumption in an integrated web application. We will suggest strategies to minimise water wastage where relevant. To calculate water consumption, we will be using the Hotel Water Measurement Initiative which is an international methodology and tool created by the hospitality industry for hotels to measure and communicate their water consumption.
 
Based on our research, there are no prior solutions to help hotels automate the tracking of their water consumption.
Our website aims to minimise the effort of manually creating water management plans and provide access to premium consultant services at an affordable rate, especially for smaller hotels.
